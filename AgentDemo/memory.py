memory.py — LONG-TERM MEMORY.

Short-term memory is just a Python list of messages (see agent.py). It lives in
RAM, it has a size limit, and when it overflows, facts are gone forever.

Long-term memory is this file: durable facts, written to memories.json, that
survive across turns AND across restarts. Three jobs:

    1. EXTRACT   -- after each turn, ask the LLM "did we learn anything durable?"
    2. RECONCILE -- if the new fact contradicts an old one, UPDATE, don't append.
    3. RETRIEVE  -- pull the few relevant facts back into the next prompt.

Step 2 is the one tutorials skip and real systems die on. Step 3 is where the
keyword-vs-semantic comparison lives.

EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You extract durable facts from a conversation. The user leads
data-center site selection; they may state facts about THEIR OWN priorities and
constraints, or about a specific SITE or REGION.

Only extract a fact the USER explicitly stated that will still be true next
week and that does NOT already live in the site tools.

EXTRACT (example names only -- never copy a fact from these examples):
  "We weight power more than permitting this cycle."
                               -> The user weights power over permitting this cycle.
  "Any site over 40 months to energize is a no-go for us."
                               -> The user rules out any site over 40 months to energize.
  "Legal flagged Phoenix over the water debate."
                               -> Phoenix carries legal/water risk that was flagged.
  "We need human sign-off before committing capital to a site."
                               -> The user requires human sign-off before committing capital.
  "We're avoiding Texas this year because of grid risk."
                               -> The user is avoiding Texas this year because of grid risk.

KEEP THE REASON. If the user says WHY something is happening, that reason is
the most useful half of the fact -- never drop it. This works in BOTH
directions, and the second one is the one that gets missed:
  "we're avoiding Texas because of grid risk"  (reason second)
  "grid risk is why we're avoiding Texas"       (reason FIRST -- keep it anyway)
Both must keep the grid-risk reason. Never reduce either to "The user is
avoiding Texas". A fact stored without its reason makes the agent invent one later.

Record what the user TOLD you, not how they told you. "Legal emailed me, Phoenix
has a water problem" is a fact about Phoenix's water risk -- not a fact about the
user receiving email.

DO NOT EXTRACT (return an empty list for all of these):
  "Score Quincy."              -> a request, not a fact
  "Which site ranks first?"    -> a question, not a fact
  "Chart the sites."           -> a request, not a fact
  "Forecast Phoenix."          -> a request, not a fact
  anything YOU said, however useful it sounded
  anything about what the user wants RIGHT NOW

Never write a fact about the user "wanting", "asking for", "being interested
in", "preparing for", or "needing" something. Those describe this moment,
not the person.

Never record data that came from a tool -- scores, timelines, risk tiers, power
costs, queue lengths. It goes stale the moment the data changes, and the agent
can always just call the tool again. Memory is for context ONLY the user could
have told you: priorities, constraints, preferences, politics, history.

Write each fact as one third-person sentence -- short, but never at the cost
of the reason. Facts about the user start with "The user"; facts about a site
start with the site's name.
Most exchanges contain NOTHING durable. An empty list is the correct and
common answer -- prefer it when unsure.

You are also shown the assistant's reply. It is there for ONE reason: so you can
resolve what the user was pointing at when they said "them", "that", or "those".
Never extract a fact out of the assistant's reply on its own.

EXCEPTION -- if the user explicitly asks you to remember, note, or not forget
something, always extract it. Resolve what they meant from the reply and write
it out in full. "Remember that." after naming a constraint becomes:
  The user requires human sign-off before committing capital to a site.
An explicit request overrides every other rule above."""
